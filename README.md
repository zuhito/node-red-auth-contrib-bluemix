```
var settings = module.exports = {
...
    adminAuth: require("node-red-auth-contrib-bluemix"), // Add
...
}
```

(2) Remove current authentication settings from bluemix-settings.js ([Example](https://github.com/zuhito/node-red-bluemix-starter/commit/9f795bc899550a79b6653d68a2698e359dc3b0c9))
```
if (process.env.NODE_RED_USERNAME && process.env.NODE_RED_PASSWORD) { // Remove
...                                                                   // Remove
}                                                                     // Remove
